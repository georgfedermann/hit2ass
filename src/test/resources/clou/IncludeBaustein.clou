#*  This sample HIT/CLOU text component tests the IncludeBaustein statement,
    in the context of a component with various other CLOU statements.   #

Here is some fixed text for testing. This is fixed text for you.
#D firstName "John"       #*  this is some clou variable declaration for you. #
#B "/home/assentis/Variables.clou"  #*  this imports some CLOU text component.  #
Here is more fixed text for you.
#B "/home/assentis/archive/Address.clou"    #*  more clou text components.      #
And so it ends.
