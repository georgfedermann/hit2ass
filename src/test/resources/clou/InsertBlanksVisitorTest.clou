#
#*  This HIT/CLOU text component exposes bugs related to direct successions of
    PrintStatement and FixedText elements, and the blanks between them. #

#D firstName "John"
#D lastName "Connor"
#D temperature 312

You are #> firstName #> lastName.   #*  a blank is expected between fixed text and firstName, and firstName and lastName, not before the dot! #
#^2"RETURN"
You are "#> firstName". #*  in this case, no blanks are expected.   #
#^2"RETURN"
Please give #> firstName my love.@

#* test the algorithm if PrintStatement is the last statement in its AST branch #
#? firstName = "John" :
   /J
      You are #> firstName #> lastName@
#
Test PrintStatement without blank in the end: #> temperature#*#C.@@

Add another text to check if new lines in fixed texts are handled correctly.
And so it ends.
