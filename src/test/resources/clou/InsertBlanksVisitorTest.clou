#
#*  This HIT/CLOU text component exposes bugs related to direct successions of
    PrintStatement and FixedText elements, and the blanks between them. #

#D firstName "John"
#D lastName "Connor"

You are #> firstName #> lastName.   #*  a blank is expected between fixed text and firstName, and firstName and lastName, not before the dot! #
#^2"RETURN"
You are "#> firstName". #*  in this case, no blanks are expected.   #
#^2"RETURN"
Please give #> firstName my love.
And so it ends.
