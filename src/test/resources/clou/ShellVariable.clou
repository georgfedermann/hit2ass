#*  This text component is about the mapping of the HIT/CLOU standard function SHELLVARIABLE("varname")
    to a Java mechanism in DocBase. #

#D myValue SHELLVARIABLE("testValue")
System property "testValue" has this value: #> myValue.@
Testing the function call in the context of a print statement: #> SHELLVARIABLE("testValue")@
And so it ends.
