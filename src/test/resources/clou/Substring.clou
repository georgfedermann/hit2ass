#
#*  This simple sample HIT/CLOU text component trains the system to
    support HIT/CLOU substring expression.  #

#D myString "Let freedom ring"
#D mySubstring myString[5,11]

The substring [5,11] of "#> myString" is "#> mySubstring".@
#? mySubstring = "freedom" :
    /J
        Hey, that worked!@
    /N
        OK, we will have to fix that.@
#
And so it ends.
