#*  This sample HIT/CLOUÂ text component tests the switch structure. #

Here is some fixed text for you.
#^2"RETURN"
#D conditionVar "bruno"
#C conditionVar
    /"peter":
        Your name appears to be "Peter". #^1"RETURN"
        Adieu, Peter!
    /"bruno":
    Your name appears to be "Bruno".
    /1:
        I am one year old.
    /2:
        I am two years old.
    /35:
        I am six years old.
    /:
    For all the rest of you: "Hello, World!"
#
#^2"RETURN"
And so it ends.
