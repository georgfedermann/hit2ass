#*  This sample HIT/CLOU text component tests the while structure.  #

Here is some fixed text for you.
#S counter = true :
    Some fixed text within the loop
    #= counter counter + 1      #*  Also some meaning-less operation on a boolean valued variable?  #
    #? counter = counter :
    /J
        Grammelkn√∂del
    /N
        Backfisch
    #
    Close to the Closure
#
And so it ends.
